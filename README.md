# Born2BeRoot
Born2BeRoot project of the common core curriculum from the 42 school of coding.

I included only the steps after the basic setup.

For the first steps of the process (installing and setting up a virtual machine) you can follow this guide made by a fellow student:

The files in this repo are as follows:

1) Born2BeRoot: step by step checklist written while doing the project;

2) born2beroot - script spiegato: detailed explanation for the script required by the subject (there are many ways to implement it, this is just the one I chose);

3) domande e risposte: checklist with questions from the correction sheet and associated answers.

Enjoy.
